# Movie Database

My Software it's here to keep track of the movies you have seen so far, rate them as you will and help you identify what kind of movies you like more. 

I wrote this mostly cause I love movies and I haven't had the chance to watch any on a couple of months, I will add more features to count the ammount of times you have seen a movie, and many other things, stay tuned!

# Relational Database

I'm using SQLite with Python for my project! Here's the documentation: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

I created some editable tables that the user is actually capable of editing himself, haven't put many of them yet, 
but this is just a start. 

# Development Environment

I like using VS Code for Python, lately I've been trying to get used to PyCharm, but it's still a work 
in progress, anyway, I used the sqlite3 module on Python, which allows me to have a local database without 
the need of a server anywhere, just my computer, of course I would like to have something different on the 
future for when my Software has it's own app or site.
